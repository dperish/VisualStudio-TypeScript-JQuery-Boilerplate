# VisualStudio-TypeScript-SystemJS-JQuery-Boilerplate

Adapted from the "HTML Application with TypeScript" project template, including the following libraries:

- TypeScript 2.0 Configration
- SystemJS
- JQuery 1.12.4
- Q
- LESS (Built Via WebCompiler)

The intent was to create a starter-solution that can be used to bootstrap JQuery
projects targeting vintage browsers/JQuery plugins.

### Notes
The solution was created in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, with WebEsstentials 3.0.325 and 
Web Compiler   1.11.326.  NuGet packages were used for all of the included scripts wherever possible.
